# Lead-Scoring
The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google.
Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos.
When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. 
Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor.
Around 30% of the leads get converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’.
Used GLM Logistic regression model to predict who and all could be the potential leads in the future.
The model performed well with the sensitivity and specificity score > 90%
